# Computing and Networking {#part:computing status=ready}

The goal of this section is  to introduce students to essential technical skills for robotics. Networking allows student's base stations' to talk to their drones. Bash allows students to run programs using just a text interface. Combining the knowledge of networking and bash, students can do cool things on the drone, such as make an LED blink, and eventually make their drones fly.
