## Bash


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_NGSS: HS - ETS1 - 2_: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

_ISTE: 1. d._: Understand the fundamental concepts of technology
operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to complete the below Bash terminal task.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Basestation Setup

35 min: Bash Lesson

20 min: Bash Terminal Task

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials:**

Basestation, a projector (optional) 

**Classroom Set Up:**

Teachers can write a DO NOW on the board for students to set up their basestations.

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:**

-  This will be a lesson for the student on Bash and the Shell. It is important to learn how to utilize a shell as it is the introduction to the inner processes of the operating system. Additionally, the shell will be our gateway to interacting with the Pi on our drone.
- Conceptually connect Bash to Markdown in the sense that the computer is being affected via text: the purpose of Bash is to “control” the computer vs whereas Markdown is utilized for the purpose of "visual layout."

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

Teachers can either use a live demonstration of the exercise via a projector using the webpage for the Pi's text editor where students follow along, let students follow along with the student book instructions, or utilize an online Bash tutorial (see _Useful Resources and References_ below) that the students can work through as an alternative. 

-  (Optional) Have the teacher check off the outputs in the terminals for the exercise

By the end of the Main Lesson, students should be able to:

- See basic information in the terminal and navigate the file system (pwd, ls, cd).
- Creating and removing files and directories (touch, rm, mkdir, rmdir).
- Using a carat to output to a file (e.g. "echo 'foo' >bar.txt").
- Printing output in the terminal (echo, cat).
- Clearing terminal output and exiting (clear, exit).

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

Better: Exercise: Students should do the exercise in the textbook with Bash commands to test out their knowledge of the terminal. They can do this through the online web editor when connected to the Pi.
