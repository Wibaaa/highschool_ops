Flight has fascinated humans for millenia.

The aim of this course is to empower people to build robots. Students
will build, program, and fly an autonomous drone. This book covers
everything needed to program an autonomous robot, including safety,
networking, state estimation, controls, and high-level
planning. Although the book focuses on an autonomous drone, we will
provide a broad overview of modern robotics, including some topics
relating to autonomous ground vehicles and robotic arms.

We will use the Duckiedrone to introduce concepts related to safety,
control, state estimation, networking and communications, and mapping.
Each student will build and program their own small quadcopter.  After
taking this course, students will be able to:

* Explain the space of designs for robotic communications, safety,
  state estimation, and control.

* Apply that knowledge to construct programs for communications,
  safety, state estimation, and control.

* Build, program, and operate an autonomous robot drone.
