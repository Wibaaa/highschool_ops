# Sensors, Actuators, and Control: 3 {#part:sac3 status=ready}

The goal of this section is to introduce the theory behind how brushless motors work, as well as the intertial measurement unit (IMU), which is a required sensor on every drone. Understanding how the motors work motivates the need for an essential drone component: the electronic speed controllers (ESCs), which control the speeds of the motors. Understanding the IMU reveals how the drone is able to determine its own roll, pitch, and yaw, which is essential for the drone to fly.
