# Localization {#part:localization status=ready}

Localization allows the drone to know where it is above a predefined map. In the case of the drone, the "map" is a picture of the surface that the drone is flying over. The goal of this section is for students to understand the high-level concepts of localization using fun exercises, and then to use the localization features on the drone to fly to specific positions in maps that they create.
