## Simple Circuits 


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_ISTE 4. d._: Exhibit a tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and the capacity to work with open-ended problems. 

_NGSS HS-PS3-5._: Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to construct a circuit with lighted LED, and with brightness that can be varied.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Hook with balloon example

15 min: Explaination of static and current electricity

30 min: Hands-on circuitry activity

10 min: Share-out on build process

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Activity recommended to be done in pairs. Teachers should pair students to support each others needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher materials**

Balloons, teaching method for static and current electricity

**Classroom Set Up**

May be helpful to have materials already on students' desks. 

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:** 

- Teacher demonstrates the balloon static electricity experiment either on themselves or a student volunteer. Explain why the balloon sticks to the wall. (Teacher's discretion to do the experiment in class, or simply review it). 
- The main purpose of this is to introduce electricity and how it interacts with objects in a classic experiment. This lesson will go deeper into transfering electricity purposefully through other means than a balloon. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

- Use this [image](https://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/electricity/circuit_analogy_water_pipes.html), or one of your own to compare electricity to water flowing through pipes using a pump. 

- Indroduce the topics of resistance and voltage. 

- Discuss how to get a current to move using different energy conversions (battery, generator, etc.).  

- If time, discuss how different materials conduct electricity differently (Conductors vs. Insulators). 

See also: Provide students with [this diagram of the circuit](https://www.resistorguide.com/pictures/resistors-in-LED-circuits.png), as well as the actual resources from the student book. 

Note: Warn students not to connect LED straight to battery without the resisitor in the circuit.)

Better: Exercise: Let students trial and error their first build attempts. Ask students to try different resisitors, reverse the resistors, and reverse the LED and see what happens. Teacher should also show [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd5GtGVcdDc) as an example of an LED burning out. 

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes

Better: Exercise: Group Discussion: Teacher leads discussion based on the following questions:

Q: "What did you learn?"

Q: "What affect did the resistors have? What happened when you reversed their order?" (Follow up with a brief description of polarity in circuits)

Q: "Did anything go wrong?"

Q: "What do you still want to know about circuits?"
