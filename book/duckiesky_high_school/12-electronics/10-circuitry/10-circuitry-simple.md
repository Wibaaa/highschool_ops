## Simple Circuits 


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_ISTE 4. d._: Exhibit a tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and the capacity to work with open-ended problems. 

_NGSS HS-PS3-5._: Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to construct a circuit with lighted LED, and with brightness that can be varied.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Hook with balloon example

15 min: Explaination of static and current electricity

30 min: Hands-on circuitry activity

10 min: Share-out on build process

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Activity recommended to be done in pairs. Teachers should pair students to support each others needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher materials**

Balloons, teaching method for static and current electricity

**Classroom Set Up**

May be helpful to have materials already on students' desks. 

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:** 

- Teacher demonstrates the balloon static electricity experiment either on themselves or a student volunteer. Explain why the balloon sticks to the wall. (Teacher's discretion to do the experiment in class, or simply review it). 
- The main purpose of this is to introduce electricity and how it interacts with objects in a classic experiment. This lesson will go deeper into transfering electricity purposefully through other means than a balloon. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

- Use this [image](https://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/electricity/circuit_analogy_water_pipes.html), or one of your own to compare electricity to water flowing through pipes using a pump. 

<!-- gwnote: my computer took a long time to display this image, could be worth mentioning or using another link. there are a lot of good images online, so shouldn't be tough to switch. Could also be worth finding a simulator that shows electricity flowing through a circuit, and explaining the water analogy. -->

- Indroduce the topics of resistance and voltage. 

- Discuss how to get a current to move using different energy conversions (battery, generator, etc.).  

- If time, discuss how different materials conduct electricity differently (Conductors vs. Insulators). 

<!-- gwnote: mention that for students with an interest in chemsitry, you can relate conuctors and insulators to the periodic table and the number of valence electrons which conduct electrcity -->

See also: Provide students with [this diagram of the circuit](https://www.resistorguide.com/pictures/resistors-in-LED-circuits.png), as well as the actual resources from the student book. 

Note: Warn students not to connect LED straight to battery without the resisitor in the circuit.)
<!-- gwnote: it is worth explaining that some elements are directional, meaning electricity can only flow through them in one direction. LEDs are directional but resistors are not -->

Better: Exercise: Let students trial and error their first build attempts. Ask students to try different resisitors, reverse the resistors, and reverse the LED and see what happens. Teacher should also show [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd5GtGVcdDc) as an example of an LED burning out. 

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes

Better: Exercise: Group Discussion: Teacher leads discussion based on the following questions:

Q: "What did you learn?"

Q: "What affect did the resistors have? What happened when you reversed their order?" (Follow up with a brief description of polarity in circuits)

Q: "Did anything go wrong?"

Q: "What do you still want to know about circuits?"

<!-- gwnote: we should try to connect this lesson to the drone. How are these concepts used on the drone? Explain how drone uses battery to power the electronics, and where current, voltage, and resistance fit in. Another example: voltage is used to measure how full a battery is. Use the multimeter to check your LiPo battery. (note that it is actually tricky to measure how full a battery is since we can't actually measure charge, but voltage is a good indicator. Not sure if we need to include that side note here though. But it is an intersting point, especially if we want to include the concept of "charge" as well which is relevant to the first lesson with static electricity. ) -->
