## Troubleshooting Soldering

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_NGSS: HS-PS3-3_: Students who demonstrate understanding can design, build and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy. 

_ISTE: 1d_: Students: understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to solve common soldering errors. 

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Intro

40 min: Problems and Solutions for Soldering

5 min: Ending the lesson

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Activity recommended to be done in pairs. Teachers should pair students to support each otherâ€™s needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials**

Should have a set of their own to demonstrate to students (or simply demonstrate on a student's kit). 


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:** 

- This lesson is necessary for students to have a grasp on how to troubleshoot problems with their soldering. Teachers should display mitsakes they've made in soldering the wires on their drone, and demonstate/explain how they fixed the problem.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

The teacher should present an array of problems such as (but not limited to):

- Cold joints

- Joints with too much solder

- Joints that don't flow properly

Some troubleshooting solutions a teacher may present are:

- Inspecting all joints carefully

- Cleaning

- Using the multimeter

- Testing strength of joints with fingers


Better: Exercise: Students should use materials listed above and have partners create bad soldering jobs (too much solder, bad connection), and have their partner diagnose and troubleshoot. More importantly, the students should focus on how these soldering mistakes. The teacher should walk around the class, making sure the student's aren't causing any harm to the materials unnintentionally. The teacher could also give out some of the student's past soldering jobs that failed, and possibly ask the whole class to diagnose it together.


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Clean up! This practice will use a lot of materials, so be sure to have students clean up their workspaces.
