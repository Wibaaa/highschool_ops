## Intro to Soldering

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_NGSS: HS-PS3-3_: Students who demonstrate understanding can design, build and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

_ISTE: 1d_: Understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.


### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to use the correct wire stripper gauge for each wire to successfully strip and tin the ESC, Motor, BEC, Red and Brown Wire.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

1 min: Hook

54 min: Intro to Soldering Lesson

5 min: Clean Up and Optional Exit Ticket


### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Students with dexterity problems. Inclusion might be teacher/student assistance, helping other students with gathering material, cleaning, taking care of equipment etc.


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

**Teacher Materials:**

Screen to play video (if desired), examples of correctly cut and tinned wires

**Classroom Set Up:**

Teacher can write a DO NOW on the board for students to grab their drone kits and sit at their maker’s space. 


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 1 minute

**Hook:** 

-  This will be students’ first step to building their own drone. It is important to learn and practice basic soldering skills here so that they can feel confident when doing more advanced soldering work later on on the drone.

See also: It is important to prepare the grunt work so that their drone building is easier and faster.

See also: Working here and knowing how to use maker’s tools will give students the knowledge and tools to embark on other electrical/maker projects. 


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 54 minutes

Wire Gauges and Stripping:

-  Reintroduce the 4 ESC, 4 Motor, 1 BEC and 1 Red and Brown wire pair found in the flight control box and where to find in students’ drone kit. Students should gather these materials and set them on the side.

-  Take one of them (that is pre tinned) and point out where to find the wire gauge.

Note: The gauge is written on the wire coating. It will be a number followed by AWG (American Wire Gauge). A pre tinned wire is a wire tinned at the factory. It looks shiny on the tip and the end cannot be frayed.

-  Take a wire stripper and show where the wire stripper displays its AWG number. Then take the model wire and strip it.

See also: You may also recommend that students use one level lower strip number if it does not work so that the wire strips easily and does not rip the internal wires.

-  Take the wire cutter and show students a pre tinned wire. Now use the wire cutters to cut the pre tinned part off. Emphasize that all wires that are pre tinned must be cut off and re tinned.

Better: Exercise: Teachers now have students strip, cut, and tin the same wire as they did and answer questions.

-  Explain what soldering and tinning is and the safety components of soldering.


Better: Exercise: Lead students through or demonstrate the process of setting up their soldering station (preheading and cleaning the iron before beginning), turning on the soldering iron, and cleaning the iron with gold curl soldering cleaners and a sponge.

Note: Each soldering iron model is different and you should know an appropriate heat to tin with.


Better: Exercise: Demonstrate how to tin using the example wire, and then have students try to tin their own wires using the instructions found in the student book or the teacher's own instruction. 

Note: The teacher should emphasize safety during this tutorial. You may use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRPF4wpXX9Q) (1:30-3:00) before or after your tutorial to emphasize how to tin.


Better: Exercise: Circulate assisting students in tinning all of the required wires. 

All wires for the following components must be self tinned: 

1. 4 ESCs

2. 4 Motors

3. 1 BEC on the IN side

4. Red and Brown Wire Pair in the Flight Control Box 


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

-  Have students clean up their work space, using the appropriate methods and safety precautions. 

Better: Optional Exit Ticket: Students will reflect and write down what they have completed and what they potentially still need to do for the next class.
