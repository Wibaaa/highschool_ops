## Robotic Marvels In Industries and Communities

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_ISTE 1. a._: Articulate and set personal learning goals, develop strategies leveraging technology to achieve them and reflect on the learning process itself to improve learning outcomes.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to explain why robotic technology is important in our day and age.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 - 10 min: DO NOW set up with discussion
<!-- gwnote:
    This agenda seems to diverge from the main lesson.
        Where is the "Robotic Marvels..." lesson? 
        Should "navigating the book/resources" be included in the agenda?

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES

### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 - 10 minutes 

DO NOW: Have students get into groups and try to write on a board more modern uses of robots than the other groups. 

**Hook:** 
 
- Robotics have become a seemless part of everyday life in the 21st century. As a generation raised in a technological era, we are able to easily overlook the idea of robotics. This will be an introduction lesson for students on the importance of robots for the world we are accostumed to. 

### Main Lesson

<!-- gwnote:
    It would be helpful to explain the goals of the curriculum overview, and to give teacher's a suggested approach for showing to students.
 -->

Recommended: 30 minutes

Better: For navigating the book, teachers may open the site on the board to add visual aid to the book explanation Or students may open it themselves by using their designated laptops.

Navigating the Book/Resources will be as follows:

- Sections

- Units

- Subsections

- References and Resources

By the end of the course, students will have a completed **autonomous quadcopter drone** controlled with their computers! With the content in the following lessons students will dive into: Safety Regulations, Hardaware, Software, and Additional Content.

<!-- gwnote:
    It could be helpful to include an exercise for the studnets to attempt come up with their own definitions for these terms.
 -->

See also: Go over the vocabulary of a _robot_ and a _quadcopter_ found in the student book. 

## ** -Live Demo of Drone Here- ** ##

- The best way for instructors to Demo their drone safely is recomended in an outdoors area. If this is not an option, a containment cage may be required. Crafting these cages may require netting and PVC pipes. For the safety of instrcutors and students, the drone should be 6 feet away when taking off.

- Teachers can share their screen on a laptop while preparing to fly. The Javascript page with in the pidrone package can show the students the drone's control panel alongside the IR sensor's readings and camera image.

<!-- gwnote:
    Link the questions to the student book where they are answered
 -->
See also: Cover the _Why is it essential to learn about this? How do robotics help our communities in society?_ section in the student book. 


### Ending The Lesson

Better: Exercise: Group Research: Students research in groups one ongoing robotics field that interest them to share with the class. Here are some examples: 

1. Medicine

2. Transportation

3. Military

4. Space
