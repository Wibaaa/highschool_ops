## Robotic History and Evolution


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_ISTE 1. d._: Understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies. 


### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

By the end of this lesson, students should understand the general development of robotics and be familiar with some of the emerging technologies in the field. 

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)


### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials:**

Could have visual aides/ slides prepared in advance of old technological inventions. 

**Classroom Set Up:**


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

**Hook:** 

- In this lesson we will take an in depth look at the evolution of robotics mechanics and inventions leading up to modern machines.

Note: Teachers can make references to the importance of robots in society from the previous lesson. 

Better: Start off by showing this [short fun clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlrr5b1XWoY) on the evolution of Robotics (Wired Episode 1). 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 20 minutes

Using the information in the student book and through the online resources below, have students do these optional activities: 

Better: Exercise: **5-5-5**: Have students get into groups, read a section from the student book (or a website) for 5 minutes, write notes bout the important points of it for 5 minutes, and present to the class about it for 5 minutes. This is a quick, interactive way to absorb information. 

Better: Have students find images on their own of past technological achievements. Teachers could put various images of old inventions on the board and have students guess what their use is.


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes

Better: Exercise: Group research: Students can be tasked to research what robotic technology is being manufactured for the future to share with the class after reading the lesson.
