## Git and Github


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

__ISTE: 1. c.__: Use technology to seek feedback that informs and improves their practice and to demonstrate their learning in a variety of ways.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to navigate the GitHub GUI and recognize basic git commands.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Computer Setup

15 min: Git and GitHub Motivations

40 min: Git and GitHub Tutorials

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials:**

Basestation, a projector (optional), worksheets printed out 

**Classroom Set Up:**

Teachers can write a DO NOW on the board for students to set up their basestations and open a web browser and have them complete the creation of a GitHub account process (step 1 in the student book) while you introduce the lesson. Teachers can hand out the worksheets located in the student book at this point if they are printed.


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:**

-  This will be a lesson for the students on understanding Git and navigating GitHub. It is important to learn how to utilize version control systems for most code-based projects. The DuckieSky textbooks are managed through GitHub, so the hope is that students will be able to directly edit and submit possible changes in our textbook to the DuckieSky Team, directly!
- (Optional) Conceptually connect GitHub to Google Drive in the sense that both platforms host file systems that multiple people can upload, download, and edit from. Emphasis that GitHub and Git are catered towards code-based projects.


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

Teachers should refer to the student book to either cover the following sections or direct students to read and interact with the following sections.

1. Students create a GitHub account if they do not already have one.

2. Students learn what Git and GitHub are used for.

3. Students learn why we are using GitHub.


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

- Students learn the basics of Git/GitHub.
    - The basics of GitHub can either be explained by the teacher or by having students learn through the tutorials in the student book at the teacher's discretion.
        1. If preferred for the Forking Tutorial's cloning and committing section, the teacher can demo the process.
    - Teachers should emphasize to the students that they are learning this material and/or going through these tutorials to be able to directly interact with our drone curriculum in a more comprehensive manner, which will become more clear next lecture. 



Students need to know the following features of Git and GitHub by the end of this lesson:

1. How to create a GitHub repository
2. Creating and handling GitHub branches
3. Making and committing and changes to GitHub repositories
4. Forking a repository
5. Cloning a repository
6. Making and merging a pull request
7. Making a GitHub issue 

Better: Exercise: Teachers can have students fill out the accompanying GitHub Defintions worksheet either while they are going through the tutorials or after they are completed with them.
