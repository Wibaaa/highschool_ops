## Git and Github


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

__ISTE: 1. c.__: Use technology to seek feedback that informs and improves their practice and to demonstrate their learning in a variety of ways.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to navigate the GitHub GUI and recognize basic git commands.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Computer Setup

15 min: Git and GitHub Motivations

40 min: Git and GitHub Tutorials

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials:**

Basestation, a projector (optional), worksheets printed out (from student book)

**Classroom Set Up:**

Teachers can write a DO NOW on the board for students to set up their basestations and open a web browser and have them complete the creation of a GitHub account process (step 1 in the student book) while you introduce the lesson. Teachers can hand out the worksheets located in the student book at this point if they are printed.


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

**Hook:**

-  This will be a lesson for the students on understanding Git and navigating GitHub. It is important to learn how to utilize version control systems for most code-based projects. The DuckieSky textbooks are managed through GitHub, so the hope is that students will be able to edit and submit possible changes in our textbook to the DuckieSky Team, directly!
- (Optional) Conceptually connect GitHub to Google Drive in the sense that both platforms host file systems that multiple people can upload, download, and edit from. Emphasis that GitHub and Git are catered towards code-based projects.
<!-- gwnote: you can take this optional exercise one step further and look at the "revision history" provided by google docs and compare this to git history -->


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

Teachers should refer to the student book to either cover the following sections or direct students to read and interact with the following sections.

1. Students create a GitHub account if they do not already have one.

2. Students learn what Git and GitHub are used for.

3. Students learn why we are using GitHub.

<!-- suggested exercise: I really like the exercises that are linked. If we wanted to, I think we could add an optional, hands-on exercises to explain the fundamentals of GitHub. For example, we could demonstrate git by having students write a couple of sentences on a piece of paper. Then, we can ask the students to make a few changes to their sentences, and record each change on second piece of paper by writing down what text they deleted, and what they added. Then We can tell students to create a new branch, and have them duplicate their sentences. Then students can make changes on the new branch and keep track of them on another piece of paper (the git history of the new branch). Then we can ask students to "merge" their branches and explain git confilcts. For this exercise, the students can resolve the conflicts however they want, but they must add the merge history to the branch that they are merging into. Then we can ask the students in the group to create a remote repository in which they combine their work. Have one student "push" their repository to a hosting service (explain that we use GitHub for this). Then, have the person who pushed the repository give write access to the other members of their group. Then, one at a time, have the other students in the group clone the repository, add their text to the file, "commit" their changes, and then "push" to the remote repo. Make sure the other students use "git pull" after cloning and before they add their own changes to ensure that they have the most updated version. Once all of the work has been combined, have this group pair up with another group. Group A can now fork group B's remote repository (since they don't have write permissions), clone the fork locally, add their own text to the forked repo, push these changes, and then create a pull request. Group B can then accept group A's pull request to combine all of the students' work!

This could be done conceptually with paper, or actually using text files on git, or both!-->

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

- Students learn the basics of Git/GitHub.
    - The basics of GitHub can either be explained by the teacher or by having students learn through the tutorials in the student book at the teacher's discretion.
        1. If preferred for the Forking Tutorial's cloning and committing section, the teacher can demo the process.
    - Teachers should emphasize to the students that they are learning this material and/or going through these tutorials to be able to directly interact with our drone curriculum in a more comprehensive manner, which will become more clear next lecture. 



Students need to know the following features of Git and GitHub by the end of this lesson:

1. How to create a GitHub repository
2. Creating and handling GitHub branches
3. Making and committing and changes to GitHub repositories
4. Forking a repository
5. Cloning a repository
6. Making and merging a pull request
7. Making a GitHub issue 

Better: Exercise: Teachers can have students fill out the accompanying GitHub Defintions worksheet either while they are going through the tutorials or after they are completed with them. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VnUXQejhmLyc5guR0zxH6mZKQFTAFXW/view?usp=sharing) is the answer key if necessary.
