# Introduction {#part:introduction status=ready}

The goal of this section is to motivate the course, as well as equip students with the background knowledge needed to consider the implications of autonomous flight. Additionally, this section gives students the ability to edit the textbook so that they can aid in its continual improvement.

This section contains three subsections: the first addresses the relevance of the course, the second introduces two tools that students can use to edit the course documentation, and the third is an introduction to the physics of flight and the hardware that makes autonomous flight possible.

We hope that this section gets students excited and geared up to build their drones.
