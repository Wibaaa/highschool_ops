# Sensing {#subpart:sac2-sensing status=ready}

The goal of this subsection is to teach students how to read and interpret the IR sensor output. Although the steps in this subsection are implemented for the IR sensor only, it should be emphasized that the steps can be adapted for any sensor. It is important to show students how to learn to use a sensor on their own so that they can reapply the steps for different use cases.
