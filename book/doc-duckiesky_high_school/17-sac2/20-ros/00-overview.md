# Middleware: ROS {#subpart:sac2-ros status=ready}


This subsection contains an introduction to the Robot Operating System, which allows different programs running on and off of a robot to communicate. ROS creates a framework for sharing data between programs. In addition to learning relevant concepts, the goal of this section is to empower students with the ability to write a ROS publisher and subscriber on their own. Again, the specific use case in this subsection is for the IR sensor; however, the steps can be generalized for other programs on the drone. Learning how to write a ROS publisher and subscriber is a reusable robotics skill.
