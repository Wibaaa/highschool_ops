## Lesson Title


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)
_ISTE: 2. b.:_ Engage in positive, safe, legal and ethical behavior when using technology, including social interactions online or when using networked devices.

_NGSS: HS - ETS1 - 3:_ Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural,
and environmental impacts.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding
By the end of this lesson, students will recognize that there are laws regulating hobby drone flight in their area, and they will be able to identify a safe environment that they can fly their drones in. They will be able to identify potential hazards of drone flight and soldering, and will learn about proper safety procedures to minimize risk of these hazards. 

Students will complete an assignment, that they can answer the questions and hand in to their teachers as homework. 

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)
5 min: Introduction to the lesson. 
40 min: Students will analyze a case study, learn about FAA rules, be able to recognize a safe space for flight, learn about safety hazards and the pre flight checklist.

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Hook: The drones that students are building is relatively powerful, and can cause harm to them or others if not used safely. 

- Can show a drone fail compilation video and note the danger in those videos
    - example video:[Video](https://youtu.be/6FVeZeT_TEA) involves mostly crashes from bad locations of flying


### Main Lesson

##### Case Study: The Midair Collision in 2009

- Do case study about the Midair Collision in 2009 where safety was compromised
    - Collision between a private airplane and a sightseeing helicopter over Manhattan that resulted in 9 deaths.

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwT6yP1UXE4) of impact druing incident

- [Animation by NTSB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oHRBMs2qQQ) explaining the incident 

- Explain the causes that contributed to this: 
    - The limitations of the see and avoid concept
    - Teterboro Airport local controllerâ€™s non pertinent telephone conversation 
    - Inadequate FAA procedures and regulations

- Explain what the NTSB is, annd what are NTSB reports
    - NTSB: National Transportation Safety Board
    - NTSB reports: provides detailed account of accident.

See also: [The NTSB report of the collision](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR1005.aspx)

See also: [article 1](ttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/nyregion/15crash.html) and [article 2](ttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/nyregion/10collide.html)

Better: Have a class dicussion on the importance of this event. 

- Examples of questions that can be considered during the discussion: 
    - How might the see and avoid concept be applied to the smaller drones we are flying? 
    - What are some distractions that you might experience when flying your drone? 
    - How can we mitigate these distractions?
    - Some of you may drive cars. What safety skills from driving can be translated to flying?

##### FAA rules

- Explain what FAA stands for and what it is responsible for
    - FAA: Federal Aviation Administration
    - responsible for regulation of civil aviation: including airports, air traffic management, certification of people, certification of aircraft, and protection of US assets. 

- Students must follow FAA rules when operating their drones

- Go over some of the general important safety guidelines by the FAA, the most applicable rules for students are in the [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjEYoJe1Grx3ZsH7KuT0ExajMZIWFM91Sgr-eRX3FZM/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: Students are considered to be recreational users. 
 

##### Where to fly:

- Teachers should make sure that students understand where they can operate their drones.

See also: You may fly your drone indoors if you have enough space, as FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors. 

See also: Before flying outside, please check the FAA's website (the Chart  User's Guide or the aeronautical charts provided) to check which airspace you are located in.

See also: The B4UFLY app, which is created by the FAA, helps recreational flyers to figure out where they can safely fly and if there are any restrictions in a location. 

##### Possible Sources for Danger:

- Teachers should make sure that students understand what are potential sources of danger, and to be aware of what is happening while operating their drone. 

See also: During soldering, there are potentials sources of danger such as burns. Make sure that students are taking precaution and understand that they are operating hot materials, and must not leave anything unattended. More details will be covered in the soldering module.

See also: There are several possible sources of danger that can result from the drone: 

1. applying force to your body
2. energy discharge from the body
3. parts or propellers dislodging from the drone 
4. electric shorts and fires

##### Safe Environment

- Teachers should teach students about The Bystander Effect, and make sure that students be able to find a safe environment and have the appropriate equipment to fly their drones.

See also: The Bystander Effect: The more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation. Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.

See also: Make sure that you have a safe environment to fly indoors, and make sure this an adequate amount of space. 

See also: If students can solder or fly their drones in a designated school space, please make sure to address any rules or protocol that must be followed to ensure that students are safe.  

See also: Make sure you have equipment: 
1. Safety glasses
2. Gloves
3. Walls
4. Distance
5. Net (not required)

##### Pre-flight Safety Checklist

- Teachers should make that before students fly their drones, they must make sure that they have checked all steps of the pre-flight safety checklist. 

Before you fly, you should make sure that: 

1. Am I connected to the correct drone?
2. Safety glasses are on?
3. Do I have space to fly? Possibilities of flying away or collisions?
4. Check the kill switch and ensure that it works
5. Are the propellers armed?

##### First Flight:

- Teachers should supervise students for their first flight. 
    - There are many potential problems that could occur with the first flight due to incorrect build or just it being the students' first experience controlling the drone. 

See also: The first time you fly the drone or start the drone, there may be some situations you may experience/be aware of:

1. Drone flips (propellers are on upside down)  
2. Collisions (No side or back sensors)  
3. Battery mishaps (when the battery shorts or explodes)  


##### Assignment for students: 

Better: Take [home assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1poSQFkOB8Ye5RvB5iptiYyRnIeacTpSrlOOc4-FSNPY/edit?usp=sharing) for students. 

The goal of this assignment is to ask students to think critically about how to ensure robots are operated safely, and to devise guidelines for operating their robot safely.


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: X minutes/hours

- Teachers should summarize the lesson and make sure that students can complete the assignment.
