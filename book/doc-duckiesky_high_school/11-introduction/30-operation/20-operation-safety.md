## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Hook: The drones that students are building is relatively powerful, and can cause harm to them or others if not used safely. 

- Can show a drone fail compilation video and note the danger in those videos
    - example video:[Video](https://youtu.be/6FVeZeT_TEA) involves mostly crashes from bad locations of flying


### Main Lesson

##### Case Study: The Midair Collision in 2009

- Do case study about the Midair Collision in 2009 where safety was compromised
    - Collision between a private airplane and a sightseeing helicopter over Manhattan that resulted in 9 deaths.

- [Animation by NTSB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oHRBMs2qQQ) explaining the incident 

- Explain the causes that contributed to this: 
    - The limitations of the see and avoid concept
    - Teterboro Airport local controllerâ€™s non pertinent telephone conversation 
    - Inadequate FAA procedures and regulations

- Explain what the NTSB is, annd what are NTSB reports
    - NTSB: National Transportation Safety Board
    - NTSB reports: provides detailed account of accident.

See also: [The NTSB report of the collision](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR1005.aspx)

See also: [article 1](ttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/nyregion/15crash.html) and [article 2](ttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/nyregion/10collide.html)

Better: Have a class dicussion on the importance of this event. 

- Examples of questions that can be considered during the discussion: 
    - How might the see and avoid concept be applied to the smaller drones we are flying? 
    - What are some distractions that you might experience when flying your drone? 
    - How can we mitigate these distractions?
    - Some of you may drive cars. What safety skills from driving can be translated to flying?

##### FAA rules

- Explain what FAA stands for and what it is responsible for
    - FAA: Federal Aviation Administration
    - responsible for regulation of civil aviation: including airports, air traffic management, certification of people, certification of aircraft, and protection of US assets. 

See also: [FAA website](https://www.faa.gov)

- Students must follow FAA rules when operating their drones

- Go over some of the general important safety guidelines by the FAA, the most applicable rules for students are in the [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjEYoJe1Grx3ZsH7KuT0ExajMZIWFM91Sgr-eRX3FZM/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: Students are considered to be recreational users. 
 
Better: Exercise: Teachers can set up a diorama of a mini neighborhood in the classroom (with paper or boxes). Teachers can hold a paper airplane over it, and ask students to guide the "drone" through the neighborhood. Teachers can also ask students where and where not they can fly and their reasoning.  

##### Where to fly:

- Explain to students where/how they can choose a space where they can safely operate their drones.

Note: Encouraged to fly your drone indoors if you have enough space. FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors. 

- If flying outdoors, ask students to double check their airspace and restrictions/regulations in their area: 
    - [FAA's Aeronautical Chart Users' Guide](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/aero_guide/)
    - [the B4UFLY app](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly/)

##### Possible Sources for Danger:

- Explain there are potential sources of danger and students should be constantly aware when operating their drone. 

Better: Exercise: While teachers lists of potential sources of danger, students can pick out drone/soldering kit part that could present that danger. Students should also name that part(s). 

- Explain potential sources of danger with soldering: 
    - extreme heat and possible burns 
    - don't leave materials unattended

- There are several possible sources of danger that can result from the drone: 
    - applying force to your body
    - energy discharge from the body
    - parts or propellers dislodging from the drone
    - electric shorts and fires
    - faulty battery

##### Safe Environment

- Explain "The Bystander Effect" and emphasize that students should always be aware of surroundings and be ready to act
    - the more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation

- Explain that students should always make sure that have a safe environment to fly

- If students can solder or fly their drones in a designated school space, please make sure to address any rules or protocol that must be followed to ensure that students are safe or in case of an accident.  


- Explain important safety equipment: 
    - Safety glasses, gloves, walls, distance
    - net (not required but point it out if there is one in the class)

Better: Exercise: Get students to gather their required safety equipment while teacher sets up a safe flying space. 

### Ending The Lesson

##### Pre-flight Checklist

- Introduce the idea of the pre-flight checklist, and that students must go through it whenever they fly

Better: Exercise: Teachers can go through the pre-flight safety checklist as they are gearing up their drone flight for the students to see. 

- Go through the pre-flight checklist that is on the handout:

Note: Teachers should have the [pre-flight checklist handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtgmRaOTyjgUGNAs9_B03avwvllN0LdCCeAQ5GOPj6o/edit?usp=sharing) printed for each student, and make sure they always have it with them during flights. 


##### First Flight:

- Emphasize that teachers should supervise students for their first flight. 
    - There are many potential problems that could occur with the first flight due to incorrect build or just it being the students' first experience controlling the drone. 

- Go through some situations students may experience/should be aware of, students should recognize them and identify potential ways to fix them. 
    - Written on the [pre-flight checklist handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dtgmRaOTyjgUGNAs9_B03avwvllN0LdCCeAQ5GOPj6o/edit?usp=sharing)


##### Assignment for students: 

Better: Take [home assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1poSQFkOB8Ye5RvB5iptiYyRnIeacTpSrlOOc4-FSNPY/edit?usp=sharing) for students. 

The goal of this assignment is to ask students to think critically about how to ensure robots are operated safely, and to devise guidelines for operating their robot safely.


### Glossary of Terms

**NTSB:** National Transportation Safety Board. US investigative body for vehicle/transportation accidents. 

**FAA:** Federal Aviation Administration which is responsible for regulation of civil aviation: including airports, air traffic management, certification of people, certification of aircraft, and protection of US assets. 

**See and Avoid Concept:** the concept of taking action to avoid what you see. If you are able to see a ball coming at you, you can take action: catch, dodge, etc. In the Midair Collision, time was too short to be able to take any action. 

**UAS:** unmanned aerial systems: systems/vehicles with no human pilot, like drones. 

**Kill Switch:** spacebar on the keyboard which immediately disarms the drone after they have begun flying it. If something goes wrong during flight, press the spacebar. 

**OSHA:** Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration. 

**Bystander Effect:** The more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation. Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.

**B4UFLY App:** app created by the FAA, helps recreational flyers to figure out where they can safely fly and if there are any restrictions in a location.
