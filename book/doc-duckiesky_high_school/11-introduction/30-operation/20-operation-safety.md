# Safety {#introduction-operation-safety status=ready}

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: 

Hardware: Completed drone build if available, or use video resource to demonstrate the pre-flight safety check. 
No previous lessons required. 

Result: 

Students will be able to know the laws regulating hobby drone flight. They will be able to identify a safe environment for their drones to fly in and potential hazards of drone flight and soldering. Students will also learn about proper safety procedures to minimize safety hazards, and undestand the purpose of the pre-flight safety checklist.

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes/hours

Teachers should emphasize that the drone students are building is relatively powerful, and can cause harm to them or others if not used safely. 

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes/hours

##### Case Study: The Midair Collision in 2009

- Teachers can do a case study about the Midair Collision in 2009 where safety was compromised. Another brief overview is given in the EdX lectures. 

See also: There was a collision between a private airplane and a sightseeing helicopter over Manhattan. The result was 9 deaths. 

See also: There were several causes that contributed to this: 

1. The limitations of the see and avoid concept: by the time the pilot of the airplane saw the helicopter, there was no time/not sufficient enough time to avoid the helicopter. 

2. Teterboro Airport local controllerâ€™s non pertinent telephone conversation (New York Times): The controller was distracted as he was having a phone call. He did not communicate with the pilot and was unable to warn the pilot of a potential crash. 

3. Inadequate FAA procedures and regulations: There are inadequate FAA proceuures for transfer of communications between ATC facilities along that area of where the crash occured (New York Times). As well, the FAA regulations that not allow for sufficient vertical separation between aircraft flying in the region.

##### FAA rules

- Teachers should ensure that they and students are following the FAA rules when operating their drones. 

See also: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a US governmental boday that is responsible for regulating aviation and unmanned aircraft. It regulates flights outdoors. FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors.  

See also: Students are considered to be recreational users. 

See also: Faculty and staff are considered to be non-recreational users. 

See also: Here are some of the important safety guidelines by the FAA: 

1. Fly at or below 400 feet  
2. Be aware of airspace requirements and restrictions  
3. Stay away from surrounding obstacles  
4. Keep your UAS within sight  
5. Never fly near other aircraft, especially near airports  
6. Never fly over groups of people  
7. Never fly over stadiums or sports events  
8. Never fly near emergency response efforts such as fires  
9. Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol  

##### Where to fly:

- Teachers should make sure that students understand where they can operate their drones.

See also: You may fly your drone indoors if you have enough space, as FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors. 

See also: Before flying outside, please check the FAA's website (the Chart  User's Guide or the aeronautical charts provided) to check which airspace you are located in.

See also: The B4UFLY app, which is created by the FAA, helps recreational flyers to figure out where they can safely fly and if there are any restrictions in a location. 

##### Possible Sources for Danger:

- Teachers should make sure that students understand what are potential sources of danger, and to be aware of what is happening while operating their drone. 

See also: During soldering, there are potentials sources of danger such as burns. Make sure that students are taking precaution and understand that they are operating hot materials, and must not leave anything unattended. More details will be covered in the soldering module.

See also: There are several possible sources of danger that can result from the drone: 

1. applying force to your body
2. energy discharge from the body
3. parts or propellers dislodging from the drone 
4. electric shorts and fires

##### Safe Environment

- Teachers should teach students about The Bystander Effect, and make sure that students be able to find a safe environment and have the appropriate equipment to fly their drones.

See also: The Bystander Effect: The more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation. Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.

See also: Make sure that you have a safe environment to fly indoors, and make sure this an adequate amount of space. 

See also: If students can solder or fly their drones in a designated school space, please make sure to address any rules or protocol that must be followed to ensure that students are safe.  

See also: Make sure you have equipment: 
1. Safety glasses
2. Gloves
3. Walls
4. Distance
5. Net (not required)

##### Pre-flight Safety Checklist

- Teachers should make that before students fly their drones, they must make sure that they have checked all steps of the pre-flight safety checklist. 

Before you fly, you should make sure that: 

1. Am I connected to the correct drone?
2. Safety glasses are on?
3. Do I have space to fly? Possibilities of flying away or collisions?
4. Check the kill switch and ensure that it works
5. Are the propellers armed?

##### First Flight:

- Teachers should supervise students for their first flight. There are many potential problems that could occur with the first flight due to incorrect build or just it being the students' first experience controlling the drone. 

See also: The first time you fly the drone or start the drone, there may be some situations you may experience/be aware of:

1. Drone flips (propellers are on upside down)  
2. Collisions (No side or back sensors)  
3. Battery mishaps (when the battery shorts or explodes)  


##### Assignment for students: 

The goal of this assignment is to ask you to think critically about how to ensure robots are operated safely, and to devise guidelines for operating your robot safely.

#### OSHA Safety Analysis (50 points)
Write answers in answers.txt. 
Read the OSHA Technical Manual on Industrial Robots and Robot System Safety (https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html).
Perform a hazard analysis for the drone, based on the OSHA guidelines. Make sure you answer each of the following subquestions in a few sentences.


1. What tasks will the robot be programmed to perform?
2. What are the startup, command, or programming procedures?
3. What environmental conditions are relevant?
4. What are location/installation requirements to fly the drone?
5. What are possible human errors?
6. What maintenance is necessary?
7. What are possible robot and system malfunctions?
8. What is the normal mode of operation?

#### FAA Rules (20 points)

1. What procedures should you follow when flying your drone outside your school? (You might find it easiest to use the B4UFLY Smartphone App: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly/).
2. What is the closest airport to you? Hint: Make sure to check for heliports as well.
3. What are some risks of drone flight? How could people get hurt with the robot?
4. Do you need to register your drone?
5. When do you need to report an accident to the FAA?

#### Flying at Home (10 points)
