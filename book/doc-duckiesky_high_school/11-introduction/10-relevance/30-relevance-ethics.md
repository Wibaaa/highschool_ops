## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES

### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes

Hook: There are many important decisions that need to be made for situations regularly. With drones or any AI or autonomous system that you are creating or using, students must understand that there are certain moral implications/ethics/principles that must be considered and have different consequences on others. 

Better: Exercise: Group Brainstorm: Ask students brainstorm on paper in groups about ethics and important/common topics addressed by ethics. Have students come up with movie or pop culture references for ethical dilemas surround technology and robotics (examples: Back to the Future, Spiderman: Far From Home).

- Explain the origin of the word ethics:
     - the Greek origins of "ethos"

- Explain what is ethics:
     -  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes a [list](https://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf) of fundamental human rights which often closely relates to ethics 

- Explain the importance of ethics 

- Explain the ethical implications related to what AI is:
     - Bias and Fairness
     - Accountability and Remediability
     - Transparency, Interpretability, and Explainability   

- Explain the ethical implications related to what AI does: 
     - Safety
     - Human-AI Interaction
     - Cybersecurity and Malicious Use
     - Privacy, Control, and Agency

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

- In this lesson, students will learn about important ethical problems that are present in technology, autonomous systems, and engineering.

##### Correctness and Uncertainty of Algorithms and Autonomous Systems

- Explain autonomous systems, AI, ML, DL, and usage of algorithms 

- Explain the benefits of AI autononous systems and the use of algorithms in decision making processes:
     - more informed decisions, less reliance on emotions
     - clearer and transparent criteria for choices
     - systems can learn from history

- Explain the disadvantages of AI autonomous systems and the use of algorithms in decision making processes:
     - not all factors represented fully
     - chances of unexpected consequences
     - unpredictability of systems learning

#### Example: Husky Vs Wolf In Image Identification

- Explain an example of algorithmic inaccuracy due to unfair/unrepresentative data example:  

See also: University of Washington created an image classifier that can differentiate between wolves and huskies (Medium). Some photos were incorrectly classified.

See: [Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329277474_Can_Everyday_AI_be_Ethical_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Fairness_english_version
10.13140/RG.2.2.22973.31207) about Fairness involved in Algorithms that undergo ML

#### Example: Artificial Neural Network to predict risk of pneumonia patients

- Explain a simple algorithmic inaccuracy due to unfair/unrepresentative data example:

See also: University of Pittsburgh studied a system used to predict the risk of pneumonia patients. From the data it was learning from, the autonomous system simply believed that the presence of asthma results in being low risk and classified patients as so, which was incorrect and problematic (Medium). 

See:[Article](https://becominghuman.ai/its-magic-i-owe-you-no-explanation-explainableai-43e798273a08) with more detail about Pneumonia and Asthma Risk System


#### Example: Teachers can teach about an example of Algorithmic inaccuracy: The Boeing 737 MAX.

- Explain the incidents involving the Boeing 737 MAX

- Explain why MCAS was added and how the MCAS and a faulty sensor contributed to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX 

- Explain other flaws with the incident:
     - insufficient testing
     - lack of accountability
     - lack of notice to pilots

##### Algorithmic Bias

- Explain that algorithmic bias can result from multiple sources:
     - biased programmer
     - biased data sources
     - other unexpecred source of bias in data

#### Example: Amazon: Congress Matched to Criminals 

- Explain another example of algorithmic inaccuracy, this one is more applicable to humans. 
     - Rekognition: a facial recognition software. 
     - ACLU tested the software by matching Congress members, and the result was members were matched with criminals. 
     - 40% of the inaccurate image matches were of people of color of the congress (ACLU NorCal). 

- Explain risks with its implementation in law enforcement:
      - biased initial encounters

#### An example: Autonomous systems and identification by skin tone

- Explain about a consistent problem in AI systems: how they identify people of different skin tones

See also: autonomous soap dispenser by Technical Concepts had trouble dispensing people for darker skin color.

See also: autonomous cars had trouble sensing pedestrians of darker skin color.

- identify possible reasons that contributed to these systems not working such as lack of diversity in workplace, IR sensors

Note: While this is presented in a very game-like way, it is very interesting to take into consideration moral concepts that we think about in extreme situations. 

#### Security, on time, backups, as these systems become relied upon 

- Explain that there are many systems in society that utilize autonomous systems that are important to society. 

- Explain open source and close sourced code
 
- Explain there has been ongoing debate whether important systems and algorithms should be close or open sourced. 

- Explain an interesting question: how much trust do we put into these autonomous systems? People can easily use these systems in ways that are beyond what developers anticipate. 

#### An example: Autonomous Systems Used in Social Credit System Development in China

- Can explain example of a system that utilizes AI: China's Social Credit System

- Explain disadvantages/concerns with the use of China's social credit system (ie social inequality and alienation, lack of free market) and explain benefits (ie: reduce the amount of crimes/bad habits). 

See: [article](https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/) on China's Social Credit System

### Glossary of Terms ###

**Ethics:** The term ethics originated from the word "ethos", which is Greek for "way of living" (BBC). Ethics incorporates moral principles and values. It affects how we choose to live our lives, what we think is wrong and right, and what our responsibilities are (BBC).

**AI:** Artificial Intelligence allows systems to gain the potential to accomplish tasks that usually requires the intelligence of humans or decision making skills. 

**DL:** Deep Learning is a portion of AI that replicates the human brain by processing data involved with object and speech recognition, and making decision. It enables AI to learn without guidance of humans, and relies on data matching and analysis algorithms from data that can be unstructured and unlabelled (Investopedia). 

**ML:**  Machine Learning is a portion of AI that lets systems automatically learn and improve from their experiences without programming it into the system. 

**Open source code:** when the source code can be accessible by the public. 

**Closed source code:** when the source code cannot be accessed by others, or it remains classified, only seen by those who are authorized to.
