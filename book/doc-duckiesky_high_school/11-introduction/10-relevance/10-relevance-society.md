## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 - 10 minutes 

Do Now: In a piece of paper write down robots you are aware of in the world. How are these robots aiding communities and industries? **Teachers can search in a web browser a selected few of the students contributions to showcase them.**

**Why is it essential to learn about this? How do robotics help our communities in society?**

Robotics matter because they hold a part of the key to the future with efficiency for most if not all crafts.
In essence it is an interdisciplinary research area part of Engineering and Science. It involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The end goal is to materialize the designs of intelligent machines that out perform a human beings ability in a specific task or replace said human in a task too complex or far too dangerous. Making them near perfect multi use tools for industries and corporations of any kind. 

Today robots impact everyday life in the service industry, with potential to positively transform work practices.
