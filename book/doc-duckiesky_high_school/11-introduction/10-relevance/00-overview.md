# Importance of Robotics {#subpart:introduction-relevance status=ready}

This subsection is designed to introduce autonomous drones within the historical and societal context of robotics. Robotis didn't simply "exist," and the ethical issues that technology poses are still major concerns. It is important to build up to autonomous flight to illustrate the process of scientific discovery and the evolution of technology. The goal is to show students how technology advanced in the past to the point where it is now, so that they are more aware of how they can advance today's technology into tomorrow.
