## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Pre Class:

Do Now: Teacher writes on the board for students to open up their computers/devices and open up a web browser

Hook: Teachers can talk about the following or their own.

-  This will be a lesson for the student on understanding Git and navigating GitHub. It is important to learn how to utilize version control systems for most code-based projects. The DuckieSky textbooks are managed through GitHub, so the hope is that 


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 40 minutes

1. Students learn what Git and GitHub are used for 

2. Students learn the basics of Git/GitHub

Note: Git is a widely used version control system. Version control systems are software programs that allow programmers and code-based project workers to manage the changes to their code-based projects over time with new versions.

Note: GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, or an online datastructure that is a basis for storing and presenting these code projects.

See also: The basics of GitHub can either be explained by the teacher or by having students learn through the following [Introduction to GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Forking Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) at the teacher's discretion.

See: In the Forking Tutorial, the students do not need to use GitHub Desktop or a text editor as of now. If preferred, the teacher can demo the process, or the students can only read the section such that they are aware how clones and commits are done. 


Student's need to know the following features of Git and GitHub:

1. How to create a GitHub repository
2. Creating and handling GitHub branches
3. Making and committing and changes to GitHub repositories
4. Forking a repository
5. Cloning a repository
6. Making and merging a pull request


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

- Teacher's demonstrate how our textbooks are hosted through Github
- Students will be able to submit pull requests to make changes to the books directly that can be approved by the DuckieSky team!
- The books are written in Markduck, which will be covered in the next lesson

TODO: Insert a Video Demo of editing our documents using GitHub

Teachers either can do a live demo of the process demonstrated in the video above of the  or show the video to the class.

- [Here](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/duckumentation_contribute_simple.html) is the Duckietown documentation on how to edit and submit pull requests the documentation with GitHub.
- [This](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/downloads/duckiesky_high_school/docs-duckiesky_high_school/branch/daffy/doc-duckiesky_high_school/out/) is the location of the teacher-based book that should be used to demonstrate the repository.
