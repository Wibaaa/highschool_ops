Requires: Previous Lesson - [Signals and Connections](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/downloads/duckiesky_high_school/docs-duckiesky_high_school/branch/daffy-develop/doc-duckiesky_high_school/out/electronics_circuitry_signals.html)


Results: 

- The ability to differentiate between examples of continuous signals and those discretized in time and/or value 

- Know the purpose of discretizing continuous signals

- Know the general pathway for measuring a physical system 

- Get a sense of the potential limitations of electrical sensors

## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 mintues 

Let students brainstorm the things that can be measured and lead a review what our drone’s three sensors measure: 

- IR sensor - measures distance

- IMU sensor - measures acceleration 

- The camera - measures planar motion


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 30 minutes 

1. **Explain the definition of roll, pitch, and yaw.**

See also: **Optional Excercise: Have your students make paper airplanes to physically demonstrate roll, pitch, and yaw. 


Ask the students to identify which of the sensors measure each of them (IMU for roll and pitch, camera for yaw)

2. **Explain how computers interpret sensors' output.** 

Bad: Problem: Refer to the [signals lesson](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/downloads/duckiesky_high_school/docs-duckiesky_high_school/branch/daffy-develop/doc-duckiesky_high_school/out/electronics_circuitry_signals.html) that computers can only understand a finite set of numbers, so we need to convert sensors' output to a finite set of numbers. 

Better: Solution: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)!

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Voltage or Current is produced by the sensors -> amplification (convert to voltage if necessary) -> ADC

3. **Introduce a new question.** 

Q: What if we want the data in between those signals? Or if we want to predict the future values?

A: Interpolation (estimate the data points in between known data) and extrapolation (using the current trend to predict the future data)

TODO: Need to think of ways to build intuitions for sensor calibration

4. **Sensors are not always correct.**

First, we need to calibrate it with equations that were proven to be pretty good. (Be careful with units!)

There are two measures of the “goodness” of a sensor: 

    1. Accuracy: How close are the measurements to the truth

    2. Precision: How close are the measurements of the same item to each other 

<!-- could put in graph about accuracy and precision-->

**Problem**: Sensors have errors, too! Just like the signal noise from the [electronics unit](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/downloads/duckiesky_high_school/docs-duckiesky_high_school/branch/daffy-develop/doc-duckiesky_high_school/out/electronics_circuitry_signals.html).

**Solution**: 

    - Filtering Frequencies: cut the frequency measurements that are unreasonably high or low

    - Combining data from multiple sensors

    - Cleverly decide which data are trustworthy


### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes 

See also: **Exercise**: Mimicking the second way (combining data from multiple sensors) that make sensors more accurate – students individually measure something (a distance, number of jelly beans in a jar, or any other creative activities) and then averaging the individual guesses.
