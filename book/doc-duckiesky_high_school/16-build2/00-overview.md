# Build: 2 {#part:build2 status=ready}

In this part of the build, students will be adding thir first sensor to the drone -- the infrared (IR) sensor. The motivation for adding the IR sensor is to measure how high the drone is while flying. By the end of this build part, student's should be able to see the output of their IR sensors in a web browser using the drone's web interface.

Build Part 2 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part2_overview.html)
