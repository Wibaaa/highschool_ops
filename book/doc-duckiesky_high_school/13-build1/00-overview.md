# Build: 1 {#part:build1 status=ready}

[Student version](+duckiesky_high_school_student#build1)

The goal of this build part is to get power to the Raspberry Pi so that the students can use it to learn to program. Students will make the circuit connections using the soldering skills that they gained from the Soldering subsection. By the end of this build part, students should be able to power up their Pis and connect to them on their base stations.
