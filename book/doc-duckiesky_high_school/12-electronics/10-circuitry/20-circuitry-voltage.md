### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Activity recommended to be done in pairs. Teachers should pair students to support each other's needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: (Set for one pair) - 9V Battery, 9V Battery clip, 4 Alligator clip leads, LED, Various (Need to specify ohm values later) Resistors, Multimeter

For Teachers: Presentation device for explaination of topics


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Put students into pairs. Give each pair a multimeter and battery and give them a couple minutes to answer these two questions: "What do you know about this device?" and "What questions do you have?" (Let them play around with it.) Then let them share out answers as a class.

### Main Lesson

1. Recommended: 10 min - Build and measure first circuit

Give the students materials to build a circuit similar to last class's except without the LED. Show them how to measure voltage, resitance, and current with the multimeter.

2. Recommended: 15 min - Explaination of Ohm's Law

Show how voltage, resistance, and current relate mathmatically using Ohm's law. (A graphic may be helpful, similar to one listed below in resources.)

Bring up a chart of ohms/distance for a copper wire of varying gauges, show process of picking a gauge for a given distance and resistance

“Short circuit”, low resistance, unintended, alternate path through the circuit, how that could damage components in the circuit, power source, start fire, etc…

3. Recommended: 5 min- Build and measure second circuit

Make the same circuit except for a different resistor, and ask students to prove Ohm's law using the multimeter.

4. Recommended: 5 min - Build and measure circuit with LED

Make the same circuit except add an LED, and ask students to prove Ohm's law. (It won't.)

5. Recommended: 5 min - Explaination of why LED doesn't observe Ohm's law

(Need to get good explaination!)

6. Recommended: 10 min - Explaination of AC and DC

Teacher explains difference between AC and DC. Measures AC from a wall outlet using a multimeter.

If time: Brief overview (no math) of other passives (e.g. capacitors resist change in voltage, inductors resist changes in current), actives (controlling flow, diodes as one-way valves, transistors as switches, mention that you can do logic/calculations by combining them), and “integrating circuits” into ICs, assembling those into computers, robots

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Clean Up!
