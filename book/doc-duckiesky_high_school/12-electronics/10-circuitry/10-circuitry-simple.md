</div>

## Lesson Title

Simple Circuits

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)



### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

1. Circuit with lighted LED, and brightness can be varied

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Hook - (Balloon example)

15 min: Explaination of static and current electricity

30 min: Hands-on circuitry activity

10 min: Share-out on build process

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_

Activity recommended to be done in pairs. Teachers should pair students to support each others needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: (Set for one pair) - 9V Battery, 9V Battery clip, 4 Alligator clip leads, LED, Various (Need to specify ohm values later) Resistors 

For Teachers: Balloons, teaching method for static and current electricity


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Teacher demonstrates the balloon static electricity experiment either on themselves or a student volunteer. Explain why balloon sticks to the wall. (Teacher's discretion to do the experiment in class, or simply review it)

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 15 minutes

- Use resources below, or of your own to compare electricity to water flowing through pipes using a pump. 

- also indroduce the topics of resistance and voltage (windows2universe.org) 

- Discuss how to get a current to move using different energy conversions. (battery, generator, etc.) 

- If time, discuss how different materials conduct electricity differently. (Conductors vs. Insulators)

### Student Activity

Recommended: 30 minutes

Provide students with diagram on how to build the circuit, as well as the actual resources. (Warn students not to connect LED straight to battery without the resisitor in the circuit.)

Let students trial and error their first build attempts. Ask students to try different resisitors, reverse the resistors, and reverse the LED and see what happens.

Teacher should also show video of LED Burning out.

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 10 minutes

Teacher leads discussion based on the following questions:

"What did you learn?"

"What affect did the resistors have? What happened when you reversed their order?" (Follow up with a brief description of polarity in circuits)

"Did anything go wrong?"

"What do you still want to know about circuits?"
