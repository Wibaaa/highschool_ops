# Circuitry {#subpart:electronics-circuitry status=ready}

This subsection includes analogies and hands-on experiments to convey the concepts of circuits. In the first lesson, students create a circuit to light up an LED. The concept of resistance is taught by having students dim the LED by increasing the resistance in their circuits. The second lesson provides the theory behind the experiments in the first lesson. The final lesson advances the ability of circuits from turning on lights and powering up the drone to carrying signals that contain information to help the drone fly.
