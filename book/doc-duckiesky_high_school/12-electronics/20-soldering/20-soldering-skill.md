## Lesson Title
Building Skill with Soldering

### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

__NGSS: HS-PS3-3__: Students who demonstrate understanding can design, build and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy. 

__ISTE: 1d__: Students: understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.

### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding


### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

- Intro

- Tips on how to best use soldering iron + Experiment

- Regroup and Discussion


### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_
Work in pairs, but if possible have one soldering unit for each student. Teacher should create these pairs to cater to each student's needs.

### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Teacher Materials**

Should have a set of student materials for themselves to demonstrate to students


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Teacher should demonstrate a successfully executed soldering of wires using flux to create a circuit.

### Main Lesson

Recommended: 50 minutes

Teacher should discuss and lead discussion on:

- Oxidation and how it affects the longevity of solder connections (What are other examples of oxidation? Why then should we try to prevent oxidation?)

- Flux, and how applying it to connection points before soldering can make for easier application of solder ("What do you think the soldering experience with flux versus without will be?")

- How different temperatures of the soldering iron can affect how well the solder applies

These topics are very relevant to the construction of the drone, since it is impertive that the soldering is well done and strong, with no oxidation that could mess up a circuit.

PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) and PCB delamination is also imporant to discuss. Delamination occurs when too much heat is applied to the board, and bubbles and cracks form. That is why you shoudl never keep the soldering iron on a PCB for and extended period of time, as it can ruin the component. Here's an in-depth [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8KVvfdcxfU) about PCB delamination, but the explaination here is suitable for most classroom needs.

If there's time through-hole soldering is another form a soldering used on the Pi on the drone. This is simply when a wire is stuck through a previously made hole on a PCB. To complete through hole soldering, tin the wire, stick it through the pre-made hole, and solder the tip of the wire to the metal surrounding the hole.

__Student Experimentation__

Give the students the tools in the materials section (spare wire, soldering tools, and flux), and ask them to solder wires together with and without flux, while also showing them how to get acclimated to using the various materials. This half hour should be dedicated to students becoming familiar and comfortable with using the soldering iron combined with flux.

To solder with flux, simply follow trhe steps of soldering from the previous lesson, except before tinning the wire, stick the soldering iron into the flux and apply it on the wires. This will make the solder flow easier, but is not always necessary.

Teacher should check student's soldering joints as the students are working.

Heads up for next lesson: Keep all soldering joints that are weak or problematic, they will be useful in the next lesson.

### Ending The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Teacher should ask the students, on a scale of 1 to 10, how comforable they feel with the tools. If the majority of the class still feels uncomfortable, it might be wise to take half of another class to continue to work on their skills.
