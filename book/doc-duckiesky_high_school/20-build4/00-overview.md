# Build: 4 {#part:build4 status=ready}

In this section of the build, students will attach the camera, and finalize the drone assembly. By the end of this build part, students will be ready to fly. Be sure that students follow all of the build checkpoints to make sure that their drones are functioning properly and are ready to fly safely.

Build Part 4 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part4_overview.html)

After completing all of the build parts and checkpoints, instructors can walk students (individually) through flying by following the [safety checks and flight instructions](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/flight.html#sec:flight) in the Operations Manual.
