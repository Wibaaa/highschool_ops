# Build: 3 {#part:build3 status=ready}

In this phase of the build, students will be adding the essential elements of every drone-- the motors, ESCs, and the flight controller. By the end of this build part, students will have a configured flight controller, and will spin the motors (without the props on). It is worthwhile to emphasize the achievement at the end of this build part: it is an exciting moment because it the first time they will see their motors spinning.

Build Part 3 Instructions can be found in the [Operations Manual](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_part3_overview.html)
