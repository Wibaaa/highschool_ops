## Blinking an LED


### STANDARDS: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)

_NGSS: HS - ETS1 - 2_: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

_ISTE: 1. d._: Understand the fundamental concepts of technology
operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.


### Assessments and Evidence of Understanding

Students write a bash script to make the led that they've soldered blink.

### AGENDA (Brief Summary of Activities)

5 min: Basestation Setup

20 min: Scripts and REPLS Lesson

35 min: Writing a Bash Script

### Differentiation _(strategies for grouping, ELL, and inclusion)_


### Advanced preparation/Materials/Set Up (Including Misconceptions)

**Materials needed**

For Students: Basestation, Current Drone Build

For Teachers: BaseStation


## SCRIPT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES


### Introducing The Lesson

Recommended: 5 minutes

Pre Class:

Do Now: Teacher writes on the board for students to prepare their basestations

Hook: Teachers can talk about the following or their own.

-  This will be a lesson for the student on creating a bash script that will blink the LED on their drone. It is important to understand scripts as they will come up when continuing with programming.


### Main Lesson

Recommended: 20 minutes

- Teachers cover what a REPL is and what a script is
- Teachers show how to make and run bash scripts, delays, printing, pin setting
- Teachers speak on Pi GPIO numbering, pin capabilities (dedicated pins that canâ€™t be used)
